# Storybook

This repo contains reusable React components.

still working through: https://medium.com/@NareshBhatia/sharing-ui-components-with-lerna-and-yarn-workspaces-be1ebca06efe

trying to figure out whether or not I should use yarn workspaces to manage this repo,
as well as whether I should just move storybook into 'joshlingaround'

development plan:

1. make a side nav
1. make a top nav
1. import to joshlingaround, set up breakpoints. use top nav on smaller screen sizes

one question I'll have to figure out:

1. should all my components ship with a global style?

next steps:

1. how should text editing work for card creation?
